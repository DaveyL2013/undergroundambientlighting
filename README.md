# undergroundambientlighting

## 1.16.5 Backport

Visually increases the ambient lighting when underground, without affecting mob spawning.

Note: The way I (DaveyL2013 if this gets merged) handled configs was a little bit extreamly hacky because I have never used cloth (or really configs in general) before. Mod Menu support was removed so json editing is the only option. Sorry...
